# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch
Machine Learning from Scratch


#### -- Project Status: [Work in progresss]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to build many (if not all) of machine learning tools from scratch. Many of the codes will take inspiration from textbooks (primarily Joel Grus' and Chollet's)  as well as scipy, numpy, pandas and scikit-learn. There will be two main sections: the first will focus on non-neural-network machine learning while the second will be on neural-network (and further on deep-learning). I would like this project to serve as introduction and detailed analysis of inside-the-box implementations of many of the packages in machine learning. 

### Methods Used
* Data scrapping, data cleaning and data feature engineering

* Machine Learning: linear and logistic regresssion, k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes, decision trees and random forest, clustering, Natural Language Processing (NLP), recommender sysstems (filterings)


### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy,Pandas, Scikit-learn
* Jupyter

### Outline
## Chapter 1: Introduction. Some examples to get started
## Chapter 2: Python Crash Course. I didn't put anything here since they are standard Python materials.
## Chapter 3: Visualizing Data
